<p>This is a task where I went to use var instead of let because of flexibility purposes, prompting the user
for daily routine and concurrent activities which individuals perform, than calculating total amount of tax with 
a function created, peforming it based on whether or not the operator is based on dividers, testing the actual function,
defining the pythagorean thereom etc.
